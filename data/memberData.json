I have a few years of basic Java experience and am rapidly becoming more familiar with all web languages. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are of particular interest to me. Beside programming, I also play guitar and enjoy mixing live audio for my youth group. I enjoy camping, kayaking, and bicycle riding when I get the chance. I don't mind a good snack or a good joke, and Pizza is definitely one of my favorite foods, especially when accompanied by a cream soda.",
